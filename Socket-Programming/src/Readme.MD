The above code is for a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) network. Hereâ€™s why:

    Usage of ServerSocket and Socket Classes:
        The server side (EchoServer class) uses ServerSocket to listen for incoming client connections.
        When a client connects, it accepts the connection using serverSocket.accept(), which returns a Socket object (clientSocket) representing the communication channel between the server and the client.

    Characteristics of TCP:
        TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable and ordered delivery of data between two endpoints (in this case, the server and client).
        ServerSocket and Socket classes in Java are used specifically for establishing TCP connections.

    Key Features of TCP:
        Connection Establishment: TCP establishes a connection before data exchange begins, ensuring reliable delivery through mechanisms like acknowledgments and retransmissions.
        Ordered Delivery: TCP guarantees that data sent from one endpoint will be received in the order it was sent.
        Reliability: TCP includes error-checking mechanisms and flow control to manage data transmission efficiently and reliably.

In contrast, UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless protocol where data packets (datagrams) are sent between endpoints without establishing a dedicated connection. UDP does not guarantee delivery or order of packets, making it suitable for applications where speed and simplicity are prioritized over reliability.
