This example demonstrates basic UDP socket programming in Java, illustrating how to create a UDP server (UDPServer) that listens for incoming datagrams and a UDP client (UDPClient) that sends datagrams to the server. Unlike TCP, UDP is connectionless and does not guarantee reliable delivery or order of packets, making it suitable for applications where speed and efficiency are prioritized over reliability.
